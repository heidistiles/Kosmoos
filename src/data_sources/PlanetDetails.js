Oxidation is a type of chemical reaction that results in losing electrons. In this case, the type of oxidation is corrosion, a chemical reaction resulting in deterioration of a metal, and the type of corrosion is rusting, which specifically refers to the reaction of iron with water. Another significant feature are it's frosty ice caps, one sign that Mars likely used to have more water than it does now.",
